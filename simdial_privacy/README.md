# CMU SimDial: Synthetic Task-oriented Dialog Generator with Controllable Complexity
This is the dialog data used 
by our SIGDIAL 2018 paper: [Zero-Shot Dialog Generation with Cross-Domain Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04803). 
See paper for details. The source code and data used for the paper can be found at [here](https://github.com/snakeztc/NeuralDialog-ZSDG).

## Prerequisites
 - Python 2.7
 - Numpy
 - NLTK
 - progressbar
 
 
## Usage 
Run the following code to generate dialog data for multiple domains that are defined in the 
*multiple_domains.py* script. 
  
    python multiple_domains.py
    
The data will be saved into two folders
     
    test/ for testing data 
    train/ for training data
